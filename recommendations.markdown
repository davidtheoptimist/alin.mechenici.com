> Alin is open, fast moving, connecting people and ideas and definitely enthusiastic about new solutions, new technologies, new people and new ways of doing things. He is truly altruistic and easily shares knowledge and spends time helping people or causes he believes in. Young as he is, he is growing fast and is developing his communication and networking skills continuously.

Rodica Lupu, CEO Loop Operations

> I've met Alin at a Geek Meet conference and I've noticed from the beginning his easy going, open personality. He displayed a tremendous amount of energy, he was full of ideas and he was involved in a lot of activities. Several months later he managed to organize a conference in his birth town and I've met him again. He invested a lot of time finding speakers and taking into account all the details but in the end everything went smoothly. I'm sure that by keeping the same positive attitude he will be successful in whatever he'll do.
