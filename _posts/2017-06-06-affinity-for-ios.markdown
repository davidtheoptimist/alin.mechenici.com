After playing with Affinity Photo (by Serif Labs)  I realized I can delete plenty of photo editing apps on my iOS without any regret. I can't wait to install Affinity Designer so I can free some precious space on my 128gb iPad Pro, removing many vectorial apps. Luckily,  Matt confirms on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mattp4478/status/872355604240764928) and  [Procreate Forums](https://forums.procreate.art/index.php?topic=5842.120) that Designer is "going to happen - and it's not far away from now".

Affinity Photo can be found here: [website](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/ipad/). I strongly recommend their [vimeo account](https://vimeo.com/macaffinity) for in depth video tutorials for the iPad version or [desktop](https://affinity.serif.com/forum/index.php?/topic/10119-official-affinity-photo-desktop-video-tutorials-200/).

I guess my design workflow is about to be changed very soon.
